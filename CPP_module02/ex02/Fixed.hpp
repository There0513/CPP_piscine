        â€¢ The 6 comparison operators: >, <, >=, <=, == and !=.
        â€¢ The 4 arithmetic operators: +, -, *, and /.
        â€¢ The 4 increment/decrement (pre-increment and post-increment, pre-decrement and
        post-decrement) operators, that will increase or decrease the fixed-point value from
        the smallest representable  such as 1 +  > 1.
        Add these four public overloaded member functions to your class:
        â€¢ A static member function min that takes as parameters two references on fixed-point
        numbers, and returns a reference to the smallest one.
        â€¢ A static member function min that takes as parameters two references to constant
        fixed-point numbers, and returns a reference to the smallest one.
        â€¢ A static member function max that takes as parameters two references on fixed-point
        numbers, and returns a reference to the greatest one.
        â€¢ A static member function max that takes as parameters two references to constant
        fixed-point numbers, and returns a reference to the greatest one.*/
